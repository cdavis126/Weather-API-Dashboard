**Deployed Weather API Dashboard:** [Click here to view](https://your-app.onrender.com/)

## **Description**

The **Weather API Dashboard** is a full-stack web application that allows users to check **real-time weather conditions** and a **5-day forecast** for any city worldwide. Users can search for a location, view current weather conditions, and revisit past searches from their history.  

This project integrates the **OpenWeather API** to fetch accurate weather data, stores user searches, and provides an attractive application for easy navigation and clean formatting for UX.

- **Motivation:** This project was built to practice integrating third-party APIs into a full-stack web application
- **Why build this project:** To create a functional weather dashboard where users can view current and forecasted weather data for various cities.
- **Problem solved:** To create a functional weather dashboard where users can view current and forecasted weather data for various cities.
- **What I learned:** API integration, handling environment variables securely, managing state in a front-end application, and implementing a backend with Express.js & TypeScript. Overall, the frustration with installation of dev dependencies are CRITICAL to the application functioning well!
